Berkeley DB    New BSD license with additional requirement that linked software must be free open source
Boost          MIT-like license

Versions used in this release:

Notes
-----
The UI layout is edited with wxFormBuilder.  The project file is
uiproject.fbp.  It generates uibase.cpp and uibase.h, which define base
classes that do the rote work of constructing all the UI elements.

The release is built with GCC and then "strip bitcoin" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.
