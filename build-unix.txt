UNIX BUILD NOTES
================

Dependencies
------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb4.7-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb4.7++-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev

There is currently no libwxgtk2.8-ansi-dev debian package for Karmic.
libwxgtk2.8-dev is the "unicode" build, but for wxWidgets 2.8 "unicode"
means wchar, not UTF-8.  wchar wxString doesn't convert to std::string.

In wxWidgets 2.9, unicode is UTF-8 and that's the only version.

You need to download wxWidgets from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
and build it yourself.  See the build instructions and configure parameters
below.

Licenses of statically linked libraries:
wxWidgets      LGPL 2.1 with very liberal exceptions
Berkeley DB    New BSD license with additional requirement that linked software must be free open source
Boost          MIT-like license

Versions used in this release:
GCC          4.3.3
OpenSSL      0.9.8k
wxWidgets    2.8.9
Berkeley DB  4.7.25.NC
Boost        1.40.0


Notes
-----
The UI layout is edited with wxFormBuilder.  The project file is
uiproject.fbp.  It generates uibase.cpp and uibase.h, which define base
classes that do the rote work of constructing all the UI elements.

The release is built with GCC and then "strip bitcoin" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.


wxWidgets
---------
cd /usr/local/wxWidgets-2.8.9 or 2.9.0
