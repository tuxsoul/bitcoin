bitcoin.conf(5)
===============


NAME
----
bitcoin.conf - bitcoin configuration file


SYNOPSIS
--------
All command-line options (except for '-datadir' and '-conf') may be specified
in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be
specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the
configuration file.

The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with
optional comments starting with the '#' character.

The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using
your favorite plain-text editor. By default, *bitcoin* (or *bitcoind(1)*) will
look for a file named *bitcoin.conf(5)* in the *bitcoin* data directory, but both
the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the
'-datadir' and '-conf' command-line arguments.

*rpctimeout*='30' ::
    How many seconds *bitcoin* will wait for a complete RPC HTTP request, after
    the HTTP connection is established.

*rpcallowip*='192.168.1.*' ::
    By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed. Specify as
    many *rpcallowip=* settings as you like to allow connections from other
    hosts (and you may use * as a wildcard character).

    running on another host using this option.

*rpcssl*='1' ::
    Use Secure Sockets Layer (also known as TLS or HTTPS) to communicate with
    *bitcoin* '-server' or *bitcoind(1)*. Example of OpenSSL settings used when 
    *rpcssl*='1':
